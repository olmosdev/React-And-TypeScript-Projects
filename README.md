# React and TypeScript projects

These are small React and TypeScript projects (styled with TailwindCSS) developed with what was learned from the course called ["React y TypeScript - La Gu√≠a Completa Creando +10 Proyectos"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/) found on the platform of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

Most projects will be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 

## Guitarla

There is also an introduction to using properties (props), along with using TypeScript to define Primitive Types, Inline Types, Types and Interfaces, Utility Types, and separate Types (Assigning Types to Props).
